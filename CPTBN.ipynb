    "The City of Berlin has been slowly but steady in the last two decades. Our customer, Mistress X wanted to open a Chinese restaurant, but with the many different cultures inside the city, she now thinks about changing her plan an open a coffee shop to drawn in customers from the population. In her opinion, people like coffee, no matter where they originated from.\n",
    "Every business comes with a risk and some will have to close again as the increased number has to share their potential customers. This is the case in Berlin. The population didn´t increase proportionately to the number of restaurants/coffee shops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mistress X came to our company to help her understanding the situation and support her decision making just what kind of business will be best for her. We need to find the best position for both business choices and find out which one has the better chances to make it."

This also leads to the assumption, that more of existing Chinese restaurants will be found in the same neighborhood.\n",

    "3.\tThe locations of the Chinese restaurants in Berlin including their coordinates.\n",
    "In relation to number two, the assuming is, that while many restaurants will stick together, there will be exceptions. These exceptions are the most interesting as they can provide information about potential neighborhoods that aren´t covered right now.\n",
